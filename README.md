# TO DO LIST 
Users can input tasks into a text field and click "Add" to append them to the list. Each task is displayed with a delete icon, allowing users to remove tasks dynamically. Basic validation ensures that empty tasks cannot be added. The app utilizes Font Awesome icons for the delete functionality. This app serves as a foundation for building a basic interactive ToDo list .
